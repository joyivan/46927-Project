### Double-Blind Reviewing

Reviewing for ICML 2017 is double-blind; i.e., reviewers will not know the authors’ identity (and vice versa). Detailed instructions for how to ensure your anonymity are also contained in the above example paper. In brief, please refer to your prior work in the third person wherever possible. If you need to make an anonymous reference (e.g., if you refer to your own work that is under review elsewhere), please upload this work as supplementary material (see below). Note that anonymizing your paper is obligatory, and papers that explicitly or implicitly reveal the authors’ identities may be rejected. A reviewer may be able to deduce the authors’ identities by using external resources, such as technical reports published on the web. The availability of information on the web that may allow reviewers to infer the authors’ identities does not constitute a breach of the double-blind submission policy.

### Supplementary Material

ICML 2017 supports the submission of supplementary material, such as software, videos, or data sets. In particular, if you make anonymous references in the paper, please upload the referenced papers, so that the reviewers can take a quick look. Please also take care not to reveal your identity in the supplementary material.

However, note that submitted papers must be entirely self-contained. Reviewers are encouraged, but not obliged to look at the provided supplementary material because we also do not want to burden reviewers unnecessarily. In particular, you must not use supplementary material for extending the length of your paper. If there is material that you believe is critical to the evaluation of your paper, it needs to be included in the paper.

**The supplementary material must be submitted as a zip file, even if it only contains a single PDF document.**

Supplementary material will not be published or archived. If you want to include it in a final version of the paper, you must put it on a web site and reference the site in the final version of your paper.

### Reviewer Matching

To aid in finding good reviewers for your paper, we will be receiving help from the [Toronto Paper Matching System](papermatching.cs.toronto.edu/webapp/profileBrowser/).

As part of the submission process, you will be asked to provide permission to transfer your paper to the “Toronto Paper Matching service”, which you should accept.

### Dual Submission Policy

It is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy.

There are several exceptions to this rule:

1. Submission is permitted of a short version of a paper that has been submitted to a journal, but has not yet been published in that journal. Authors must declare such dual-submissions either through the CMT submission form, or via email to the program chairs (icml2017pc@gmail.com). It is the author’s responsibility to make sure that the journal in question allows dual concurrent submissions to conferences.
2. Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings (e.g., ICML or NIPS workshops), or with only abstracts published.
3. Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g., in arXiv). In this case we suggest the authors not cite the report, so as to preserve anonymity.

Finally, note that previously published papers with substantial overlap written by the authors must be cited in such a way so as to preserve author anonymity. Differences relative to these earlier papers must be explained in the text of the submission. For example, (This work develops [our earlier work], which showed that).

### Author Feedback

From Fri Apr 14, 2017 22:59 PM UTC to Fri Apr 21, 2017 22:59 PM UTC, authors can see the reviews and respond to their content.

Your response can be used by the Program Committee to alter their judgment of the paper, so it is in your advantage to respond. The maximum length of the response is 5000 characters.

Authors can submit one response per submission. Once author feedback is enabled, authors will see a link to “Author Feedback” from the author console. Any of the authors of a paper can enter/edit the response, and the response can be returned to and edited up to the deadline for author feedback.

Remember that reviewing is double-blind. Do not include any information in the response that can identify you or your co-authors. Please do not include any URLs in your response.

We recommend using your judgement when crafting a response. There is no need to respond to every minor question or suggestion for improvement. Rather, the response is a good opportunity for addressing issues like a reviewer’s uncertainty about a point, a reviewer making an incorrect assumption, or a reviewer misunderstanding a part of the paper.  We recommend being polite and professional.
